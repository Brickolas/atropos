Grandma's House is a novel, multi-turn **LLM environment** where the agent plays the role of a helpful grandchild assisting their grandma with day-to-day tasks. This environment stands out by combining **three distinct objectives** in a single interactive scenario: preparing food, organizing household items, and managing money. Over the course of an episode, Grandma presents the agent with these sequential challenges – for example, cooking a meal, tidying up a cluttered attic, and coming up with budget advice – reflecting real-life help a person might provide to an elderly family member.

**Theme and Uniqueness:** Set in a warm, domestic context, Grandma's House emphasizes **practical helpfulness and empathy**. The agent must navigate not only problem-solving (e.g., how to cook with what's available or suggest a yard sale for old items) but also social considerations like politeness and reassurance. Unlike many single-task environments, this scenario requires the model to **adapt to different task domains on the fly** and maintain a consistent, caring persona throughout. This blend of everyday tasks with alignment challenges makes the environment uniquely suited to training and evaluating models on both their competence and their **human-centered values**.

**Evaluation Structure:** The environment provides a rich evaluation signal by decomposing the reward and metrics along multiple dimensions. For each of the three task types (Food, Merchandise, and Money), the agent earns a separate reward when it addresses Grandma's request effectively. These rewards are simple and interpretable – did the model offer something for Grandma to eat, propose a solution for the clutter, and give sound financial advice? The **total reward** is the sum of these components, encouraging the agent to perform well on all fronts. In addition, Grandma's House tracks **introspection, alignment, and coherence** metrics during the conversation. Introspection measures whether the model engages in thoughtful reasoning (e.g., providing rationale or thinking steps), alignment checks that the model’s responses remain respectful and on-topic, and coherence ensures the dialogue stays logically consistent. At the end of each episode, the environment outputs these metrics alongside the cumulative reward, giving a nuanced picture of performance.

In summary, Grandma's House is a comprehensive testbed for **aligned assistant behavior**. It challenges an AI to be versatile (handling cooking, organizing, and budgeting), **aligned and polite** (as it interacts with a grandmother figure), and reflective in its reasoning. Success in this environment means the model can juggle multiple objectives while maintaining helpful, safe, and coherent interactions – a step toward more generalizable and trustworthy AI assistants.
